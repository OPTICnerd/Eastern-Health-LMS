<h1> TIC Practice #5: Recognize When Someone Has Been Triggered</h1>


<p>A trigger is any experience that reminds the patient of the trauma, either consciously or unconsciously. It might be a smell, a visual cue, a sound, a particular taste, a tactile sensation. Triggers can be caused by positive or negative experience. Once triggered, the patient is taken back to a traumatic memory and may be so absorbed by the memory that they lose awareness of the present moment and feel as though the past trauma is happening in the present moment. It is important to know when someone has been triggered so that you can respond to reorient the patient to the here-and-now and prevent retraumatization. It is important to have an understanding of the meaning of the person&rsquo;s behavior so that it is not misinterpreted and can be properly attended to.</p>

 Recognize signs of fight, flight, freeze, submit</p></td>
 <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans1a">
 <p>When a trauma survivor has been triggered, there will be an automatic defensive response that is either fight, flight, freeze, or submit.<sup class="ref">73</sup> Fight, flight, and freeze responses are <em>hyper</em>aroused states while a submit response involves <em>hypo</em>arousal. </p>
<ul>
 <li>A fight response might be indicated by a sudden angry response. The anger might be reflected in irritation or an aggressive action, such as pushing something or someone away. </li>
 <li>A flight response might be indicated by a sudden pulling away.</li>
 <li>A freeze response might be a sudden stiffening at the same time that the heart is racing. </li>
 <li>Submit responses involve shutting down emotionally and physically.This might be indicated by the patient becoming very still, silent and limp. </li>
</ul>
<p>When these different types of defensive responses occur, the patient is likely in a dissociative state and is caught in a traumatic memory.</p>

 Use strategies to help ground in present moment experience</p></td>
 <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans2a">
 <p>Recognizing that a patient is reexperiencing some aspect of their traumatic history, it is necessary to actively intervene in a calm and clear manner. The aim is to bring the patient back to the present moment and to recognize that they are here with you and that they are safe.</p><br>
<h3>Orient to time and place</h3>
<p> State the patient&rsquo;s name in a clear and calm voice. Ask if they can hear you. Affirm their response if they say yes. If you do not get a response, repeat their name and ask again. Ask them to look around the room. Remind them that they are in your office seeking medical care. Ask them if they know who you are. Tell them who you are. Let them know that they are safe and that no one is going to hurt them. Let them know what year it is and that they are no longer a little child. Of these suggestions, say what feels appropriate to the situation.</p><br>
<h3>Use grounding techniques</h3>
<p> Grounding techniques are useful in helping the patient to return to the present moment. There are many ways in which you can help a person become grounded. A simple way is to ask the patient to become aware of their physical body. For example, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s help you get grounded. Can you feel your feet on the floor? Great. Just notice your feet. Maybe wiggle your toes. Can you feel that? Great. Can you feel your arms resting on the chair? Good. Notice your back against the chair. Wonderful. How about we stand up so that you can really feel yourself in your body. I&rsquo;ll stand up with you. That&rsquo;s good. Ok. So how are you? Are you here with me? Are you fully here with me? 100% What percent?&rdquo; It should be noted that if a patient has dissociated and is caught in a traumatic memory, they might not feel that they are 100% returned to the here-and-now. Aim to reach at least 90% if possible.</p><br>
<p>Another grounding technique is diaphragmatic breathing. Ask the patient to put a hand on their belly and to breathe into their diaphragm so that they feel the belly rise. This is important for someone who is <em>hyper</em>aroused. If the patient is <em>hypo</em>aroused, the aim is to get the patient more activated and so the breathing technique would be to have them breath fully into their chest.</p>

 Validate and normalize response</p></td>
 <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
 <p>After a triggering situation has been managed, feelings of shame are a natural response. Validating and normalizing the patient’s response can be accomplished by conveying your understanding about how reminders of one’s trauma history can activate memories and the associated fearful response. Let the patient know that this is not uncommon for patients who have histories of trauma.</p>

 Collaborate on how to proceed</p></td>
 <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans4a">
 <p>Given that the patient has been triggered in the process of receiving health care, it is important to discuss with the patient how to proceed in order to reduce the likelihood of this happening again. It may be obvious about what can be done or it may not. But what is most important is having the conversation and solving this problem together as it is a shared problem. This shows your respect and caring along with empowering the patient.</p>

<h2>SAVE the situation</h2>
<p> Schachter and colleagues<sup class="ref">87</sup> have developed a memorable acronym &ldquo;<a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/sources/nfnts/nfnts-sensi/index-eng.php" target="_blank" title='This is an external link for additional reference purposes only. The site and/or content is not part of this Mainpro/Maincert accredited program. It will open in a new window.'><strong>SAVE the situation</strong></a>&rdquo;. When a difficult situation has occurred with a patient, they suggest that you <em><strong>stop</strong></em> what you are doing. Then <em><strong>appreciate</strong></em> what is going on with your patient. That involves taking time to understand what is happening and to help the patient with the situation. <em><strong>Validate</strong></em> the patient&rsquo;s experience and then <em><strong>explore</strong></em> how to take the next step.</p>
