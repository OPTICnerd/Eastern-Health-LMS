<h1>Chapter Summary</h1>
<h2>The Clinical Impact of Poverty</h2>
<p>For poverty, just like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sufferers are at risk of high morbidity and mortality.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Groups that move out of poverty experience a decrease in disease.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Children who have lived in poverty have increased health risks as adults.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is consistent across time, geography and different population groups. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h2>The Implications for Physicians’ Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In our practices we deal with preventive care. </li>
  <li>  Knowing that income and social status have such a profound effect on health therefore matters in our everyday work. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Advocating for our patients and finding ways to help them overcome income and social barriers is key to good health. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Recognizing the additional health risks of patients living in poverty is crucial in our everyday work and helps us transform encounters with difficult patients into productive office visits including broader problem lists and plans relevant to the patient’s unique challenges.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
