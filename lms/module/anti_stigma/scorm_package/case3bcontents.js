Two years ago she underwent left hemilaminectomy at L5-S1 after  presenting with severe radicular symptoms not responsive to conservative  therapy. There were no complications following the surgery however her pain  scores, which were 2/10 post operatively, have been increasing over the last 2  years.</p><p>  Cecily tells you that her pain scores are currently at 8/10  and are consistently interfering with her ability to do housework, work full  time at a desk job, and care for her family. She has been getting increasingly  frustrated and anxious with regards to her pain and decreased function. She has  been managed previously by a pain specialist however he retired shortly after  Cecily&rsquo;s surgery. She has been desperate over the last few months and was  re-assessed by her surgeon who prescribed oxycodone 5mg/acetaminophen 325mg one  tablet qid prn, a two month supply with no repeats. Her surgeon advised her  there was nothing more he could offer and recommended follow up with her  general practitioner for ongoing medical management.</p><p>  Cecily comes to your office today for medication evaluation.  She states that her pain has worsened in the last month and the oxycodone  5mg/acetaminophen 325mg one tablet qid prn was not as beneficial as she had  hoped.&nbsp; She is wondering if there is  something stronger that she can take.</p>";

You have been working with her over the last year in an attempt to improve her pain control and overall function. While she has made some progress (pain scores 30% less than previous, able to complete basic ADLS) she has been having difficulty working full time, shopping, or walking for any distances. While she has been doing reasonably well on her current medications, her pain control is barely adequate and she wishes to continue to work full time and remain active. You are uncomfortable increasing her Fentanyl patch dose of 75mcg/hr q 72hrs and decide to refer Cecily to a pain specialist to see whether any interventions or further medical pain control might be of benefit for Cecily's radicular back pain. </p><br><br><p class='indentLR eg' style='font-weight:bold;'>Click on the appropriate checkbox to complete Cecilyâ€™s referral.
