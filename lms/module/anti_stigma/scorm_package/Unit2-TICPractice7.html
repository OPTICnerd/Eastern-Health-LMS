<h1>TIC Practice #7: Recognize Need for Immediate Intervention or Referral Based on Risk</h1>



<p>There are a variety of ways in which a patient can be at risk and in  need of immediate intervention and/or referral for additional services. Below  we describe some common and critical manifestations of risk along with  recommendations for addressing them.</p>

   Suicidality</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans1a">
   <p><p>Suicidality is common among those with PTSD. The presence of major depression further increases the risk of suicidal behavior.<sup class="ref">76</sup> Suicidality can take a variety of forms including suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviour, suicide attempts and completed suicide. Some trauma survivors will report having suicidal thoughts every day but will have no intention of acting on those thoughts. For others, suicidal thoughts are indicative of a real risk of suicide. It is critical that the physician is able to assess the level of risk and determine what action should be taken.</p><br>
<h3>Assess current risk</h3>
<p> Assessing current risk for suicide involves asking questions about  suicidal ideation, intent, plan and attempts. Do you have thoughts of suicide?  Do you have a desire to kill yourself? Do you have a plan? What is it? Do you  have the means to carry out your plan? Trauma survivors often have suicidal  thoughts and when asked whether they want to die, they will say no. If they say  yes they do want to kill themselves, have a plan on how to do it and have the  means to carry it out, then there is serious risk and a determination needs to  be made as to whether the patient should be hospitalized. It is important to recognize that many patients with a trauma history have a fear of hospitalization because they find the experience of being hospitalized, especially in a psychiatric ward, retraumatizing. In such cases, concern about the experience of hospitalization must be weighed against the risk of committing suicide in each individual patient. </p>

<h3>Refer  for counseling/therapy, provide information on hotlines</h3>
<p>Whether  it is non-suicidal self-injury, a genuine suicide attempt, or simply suicidal  ideation with no intent, referring for counselling/therapy is warranted.  Providing information on hotlines or drop-in community programs is also useful  for providing them with ways in which they can reach out for support when they  feel distressed.</p></p>

   Child maltreatment</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
   <p>When you have reason to believe that a child is being maltreated based on what your patient has told you, it is important to engage the patient in a discussion about the situation and to include them as much as possible in planning next steps. If there is a legal obligation to report, it is important to let the patient know. Ideally, the patient should know ahead of time about your legal obligations so that they have some choice in what to disclose. Sometimes situations will arise where there is reason to believe that a child is being abused or in an abusive environment but you lack the necessary identifying information. Here it is useful to engage the patient in a conversation about the situation and the risk that the child is in. In these situations, collaborate about how to proceed and if the patient refuses to provide the necessary information, keep the door open for future discussion about this situation and let the patient know that they can make an anonymous call to Childrenâ€™s Aid Society themselves. The law in many provinces in Canada has a mandatory duty to report, with fines and/or incarceration for neglect of duty. In fact, in some provinces the law states that all citizens have a duty to report if they have reason to believe a child is being harmed or at risk of being harmed. Be aware of your legislation.</p>

   Domestic violence</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans5a">
   <p>Reporting of domestic violence is not  mandatory in Canada.</p>
<p>If the physician is concerned that the  patient is a victim of domestic violence, inquiry can start with the simple  question &ldquo;Do you feel safe at home?&rdquo; The woman might not be ready to answer but  this question opens the door for when she is ready to disclose. If she  discloses domestic violence, it is important to provide support and  information, help her come up with a plan to keep herself and her children (if  any) safe, and link her to resources in her community. Empower her to make her  own decision about what is right for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue of universal screening  regarding domestic violence, is controversial. The most recent recommendations  of WHO are against universal screening for domestic violence.<sup class="ref">108</sup> Although even within the WHO guidelines there is disagreement. The main  position is to recommend against universal screening because there is no  research to demonstrate that universal screening results in a decrease in  domestic violence and there are no empirically supported interventions for what  to do after a woman has screened positive. They advise screening only if a  woman appears to be at risk and first line support is available. A minority  position in the WHO recommendations is in favour of universal screening given  that it increases detection, there is no evidence that it causes harm, and most  physicians are not knowledgeable about signs and symptoms. The studies upon  which the WHO recommendations are based were studies that met strict criteria  for screening. Experts are in disagreement as to the appropriateness of  ignoring a vast body of research that did not meet criteria for screening (see  Schachter et al, 2009). We recommend routine inquiry about a trauma history (as  opposed to &ldquo;screening&rdquo; in the strict sense).

   Sexual assault</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans6a">
<p>Sexual assault can occur to both men and  women. However, the majority of victims of sexual assault are women. Women with  histories of childhood sexual abuse are at the greatest risk of sexual  revictimization.</p><br>
<p>If someone presents to a primary care  physician with a complaint of sexual assault, there are legal, medical, and  psychosocial factors to consider.<sup class="ref">62</sup></p><br>
<h3>1. Legal</h3>
<p> The first issue is to determine whether  the patient wants evidence to be collected for use in legal action against the  assailant. A decision should then be made as to whether the physician is able  to gather the evidence (i.e., does the physician have a &ldquo;rape kit&rdquo;) or whether  a referral should be made. Having training in administering a &ldquo;rape kit&rdquo; is  advised. The options should be discussed with the patient.</p><br>
<h3>2. Medical</h3>
<p> Consent should be sought for every step  of the examination and a victim advocate present, if possible. A history should  be taken in a compassionate and nonjudgmental way, avoiding any suggestion of  blame. The patient&rsquo;s own words should be used to document what happened. A  physical examination for injuries should be performed and immediate medical  attention provided as necessary. Collection of evidence is critical for future  legal proceedings and there are precise requirements for its collection,  physical custody of the evidence and its transportation. Evidence includes:  fingernail scrapings; head and pubic hair combings; hair plucked from the  patient; swabs of the oropharnyx, vagina, and rectum; blood and urine samples; and  patient&rsquo;s clothing. The possibility that it was a drug-assisted assault should  be considered if the patient reports amnesia. For women of childbearing years,  emergency contraception should be offered and all should be treated to prevent  sexually transmitted infections.</p><br><h3>3. Psychosocial</h3>
<p>There  is a broad range of responses among survivors of sexual assault including self-blame,  disbelief, anger, fear, dissociation, and emotional dysregulation. If there is  a history of previous trauma, this will exacerbate the response. A  compassionate and nonblaming stance with the survivor is essential. Offer a  referral for counselling/therapy.</p>

   Aggressive behaviour</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans8a">
<p>For some groups of patients suffering from PTSD, such as military, veterans, and police officers, anger can be the presenting complaint in a visit to the physician. These angry feelings are usually overwhelming and distressing to the patient. On some occasions, this PTSD-related anger can lead to aggressive behaviour, therefore, it is important when treating patients with PTSD, to ask about their anger and any history of aggressive behaviour. It is important to help patients control and manage their angry and aggressive impulses so that they do not act on them. Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy directed at diminishing anger, and increasing impulse control can be very helpful for these patients. Please refer to sections on Pharmacologic Treatments and Psychotherapy of PTSD. </p>
