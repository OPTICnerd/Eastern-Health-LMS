<h1>Common Myths Regarding MDD</h1>

<div class="Wrapper"> 
  <div class="Column03Left">
  
<ul>
<li> Moral weakness</li>
<li> Not trying hard enoughâ€”pull up your socks</li>
<li> Your fault </li>
<li> It&rsquo;s just stress we all have it and stop complaining</li>
<li> She may be dangerous or unpredictable</li>
<li> She&rsquo;ll never work as she&rsquo;s lazy</li>
<li> Don&rsquo;t rush to treat as this may pass</li>
<li> Don&rsquo;t ask about suicide, it may give her the idea</li>
<li> It&rsquo;s functional and not as serious as physical illness</li>
<li> The patient has no role in managing their treatment since it is all biological.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To counter some of the stereotypic myths of moral weakness or laziness it may be helpful for clinician&rsquo;s to be aware of newer neurobiologic areas of study in MDD. Historically, studying the function of the Brain has been more challenging than other organ systems but new technology is now making study of the physiology of mental illness states more possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Neurobiologic models for attributing symptoms of MDD</h2>

<ul>
<li> Specific areas of brain activity dysregulation in specific areas cause symptoms </li>
<li> Associated neurotransmitter dysregulation</li>
<li> Structural brain changes e.g. hippocampal volume loss</li>
<li> Genetic predisposition</li>
<li> Autoimmune dysregulation</li>
<li> Inflammatory dysregulation with systemic effects, cardiac, metabolic, and neurologic </li>
</ul>

<p>Be careful with diagnostic overshadowing and skipping over physical exam and appropriate investigations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asking about suicide reduces the likelihood of attempts as it is often a relief for people to be able to let someone else know. Most people who have attempted suicide have seen their health provider, often a family physician, within the few months before. </p>
