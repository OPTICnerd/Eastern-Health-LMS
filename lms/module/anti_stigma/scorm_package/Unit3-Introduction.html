<h1>Case: Julie</h1>

<h2>Meet Julie</h2>
<p><img src="Julie.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="238" align="left" style="margin-right:15px; margin-bottom:10px;"/>
  Julie is a slender 39 year old. She is well-groomed and casually dressed. She lives alone, is single and has a cat. She has acquaintances and work “friends” but no one to whom she feels close. Her presenting complaint is that she is suffering from stomach problems – chronic diarrhea alternating with constipation, and bloating. This problem has been on and off for years and she thinks that it is time to get it diagnosed as she worries it is impacting her ability to work. The most recent bout has lasted for a month. During history taking, you learn that she was sexually abused as a child and has no recollection of her childhood from ages 6-12. She engages in a number of self-harming behaviours including cutting, binge drinking, as well as binge eating and purging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Her trauma history is that she was repeatedly sexually abused by her father. Mother was an alcoholic and blamed her daughter for stealing her father’s affection. She thinks the abuse started around age 4 and continued into her teens. She has no recollection of the period in her life between age 6-12. When she became a teenager, father began to give her alcohol prior to the abuse. During her teenage years, Julie blamed herself for the abuse. Her father told her that it was her fault. She enjoyed the alcohol and the attention but was wracked with guilt and shame afterwards. The abuse ended when Julie went off to university at age 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Julie did well at university, she struggled interpersonally. Dating was especially difficult. It made her anxious so she used alcohol to manage her extreme anxiety. She experienced multiple sexual assaults, which reinforced her low self esteem. When her anxiety and emotional distress became overwhelming, she discovered that cutting herself calmed her.
