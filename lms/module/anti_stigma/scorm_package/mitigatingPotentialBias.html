<h1>Mitigating Potential Bias</h1>
<p><strong>In order to mitigate potential bias, the following strategies have been implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All content developed as part of this Program was reviewed for potential bias by the members of the Program Planning Committee. The members of the Planning Committee are explicitly asked for feedback on any observed bias in the learning material.</li>
  <li>An independent peer reviewer was engaged to review the Program prior to delivery.</li>
  <li> An evaluation survey is implemented as part of this Program. The survey provides Program Participants with the opportunity to indicate if the content was credible and non-biased.</li>
</ul>
