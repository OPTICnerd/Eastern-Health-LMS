  <p>Interpersonal violence comes in many forms including child abuse, intimate partner abuse, elder abuse, physical and sexual assault, torture, and war. Many Canadians who have experienced interpersonal trauma come into contact with the healthcare system. It has been estimated that in Ontario 31% of males and 21% of females experienced child physical abuse and 13% of females and 4% of males experienced sexual abuse.<sup class="ref">64</sup> It is estimated that 4-10% of seniors experience elder abuse in Canada; although 96% of Canadians believe that elder abuse goes undetected suggesting that these estimates of prevalence may be underestimates.<sup class="ref">88</sup> A 2004 survey found that approximately 7% of Canadians over 15 years of age have experienced spousal violence in the previous 5 years with women more likely to experience violence and injury.<sup class="ref">17</sup> In the past 5 years, Canada has ranked as one of the top three resettlement countries in the world, with most refugees coming from war-torn countries and likely having histories of trauma.<sup class="ref">22</sup> Altogether, these statistics suggest that interpersonal violence is a serious public health problem.</p>

  Health interfering emotions</p></td>
 <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
  <p>There are many emotions that can get in the way of a trauma survivor seeking healthcare. There are also emotions that interfere with the trauma survivor’s capacity to fully participate when they are receiving healthcare.</p><p align="center"><img src="clickhere.png" alt="" align="middle"/> <u>on the &quot;<span style="color: #a16d51">text</span>&quot; to show/hide additional content</u></p>
<li> <a href="#" onClick="$(this).nextAll('.reveal').first().toggle('fast');return false;">Shame</a>
 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Shame</strong><br><br>Shame can prevent a trauma survivor from seeking healthcare. Especially for survivors who experienced ongoing abuse in childhood, they may feel that those experiences are an inherent reflection of who they are. Shame can leave the survivor believing that they are not deserving of medical care and this can lead to an unwillingness to seek healthcare. If they do seek healthcare, the survivors may feel too ashamed to discuss their medical concerns or may be so overwhelmed with shameful feelings that they cannot fully attend to what the physician is saying.</p></p></div></li>

<li> <a href="#" class="scroll_link" onClick="$(this).nextAll('.reveal').first().toggle('fast');return false;">Guilt</a>
 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Guilt</strong><br><br> Guilt can arise out of a belief that the traumatic events are the survivor’s fault. If the person is a survivor of childhood abuse that went on for an extended period of time, the survivor may feel that they should have been able to stop it and, thus, it is their fault. Sometimes, survivors are blamed by the perpetrator who blames them as a way to shift responsibility for their actions. For an impressionable child, the survivor may accept the blame and come to believe it truly is their fault. Other adults who did not protect the child might also blame the child for the abuse. Blaming oneself can be a way to regain a sense of control. For example, “if I hadn’t worn that dress, it would never have happened.” Similar to shame, guilt can prevent the survivor from seeking healthcare because they do not believe they deserve care or it may prevent them from being completely honest about their health concerns.

<li> <a href="#" class="scroll_link" onClick="$(this).nextAll('.reveal').first().toggle('fast');return false;">Anxiety</a>
 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Anxiety</strong><br><br>Trauma survivors are often highly anxious and the anxiety is often fuelled by fear. Survivors may feel too anxious to seek healthcare because it requires leaving the safety of their home, going out in public, meeting someone they do not know or feel safe with. If they do seek healthcare, anxiety may get in the way of fully attending to what they are being told or it may get in the way of stating their needs, etc.</p></p></div></li>

<li> <a href="#" class="scroll_link" onClick="$(this).nextAll('.reveal').first().toggle('fast');return false;">Fear</a>
 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Fear</strong><br><br>Fear underlies PTSD and can be debilitating, preventing the survivor from seeking healthcare or from fully participating when receiving healthcare. There may be fear about being in public, fear of authority figures (e.g., one’s primary care physician). The fear may become generalized so that virtually anything can stimulate a fear response.</p></p></div></li>


<li> <a href="#" class="scroll_link" onClick="$(this).nextAll('.reveal').first().toggle('fast');return false;">Dissociation</a>
 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Dissociation</strong><br><br>The impact of dissociation can be quite varied. Dissociation is a response to overwhelming fear and is a defense mechanism that enables the survivor to compartmentalize their experience so that only a part of the self experiences the trauma. For example, the rape survivor may have the sense that she has left her body during the rape and is watching what is happening to her body from outside of herself. Or, it may be that the psyche splits so that one part of the self experiences the trauma, while another part is protected from it. When traumatisation is extreme, recurrent and ongoing, such as often occurs with child abuse, the psyche might split into different selves resulting in dissociative identity disorder (DID; formerly known as multiple personality disorder). The capacity to dissociate might also result in the survivor being oblivious to pain and disconnected from their bodies.<br><br>If the survivor is triggered, that is, if there is something that reminds the survivor of their trauma history, the survivor may dissociate and when they do, they are no longer fully present and aware of what is happening in the here-and-now. This can interfere with healthcare as the survivor cannot fully engage with the physician in the moment.<br><br>For those with DID, presentation in the healthcare setting can be confusing because the part engaging in the healthcare encounter may or may not be fully aware of their health history. For example, the survivor might not know how the cuts appeared on their leg or when they appeared. There can also be a concern about letting the physician know that they have DID. Hiding parts of themselves will mean that the provider has an incomplete picture of what is going on.

<li> <a href="#" class="scroll_link" onClick="$(this).nextAll('.reveal').first().toggle('fast');return false;">Dysregulation</a>
 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Dysregulation</strong><br><br>Survivors who struggle with affect dysregulation may experience their emotions swinging from being overwhelmed with distress to feeling completely numb. They can be perceived as difficult to work with given their emotional reactivity to apparently minor stimuli. When in the throes of strong emotion (i.e., either intense distress or dissociation), they often find it difficult to soothe themselves and it is in these states that they are vulnerable to engaging in self-injurious behaviours or using drugs or alcohol.</p></p></div></li>

<p class="simplebox"><strong>Powerlessness</strong><br><br>As a result of experiencing overwhelming trauma that the survivor could not control a belief that they are fundamentally lacking in power sets in, particularly in situations where there are power imbalances such as in a doctor/patient relationship. Authority figures are often threatening because they are deemed to hold all the power and it can be too anxiety provoking to seek care. When they do seek care, they may be afraid to be completely honest and forthcoming about their health. They may be afraid to ask questions, to ask for clarification, or to state their needs.</p></p></div></li>

 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Helplessness</strong><br><br>A belief that one is helpless goes hand in hand with feeling powerless and out of helplessness arises a belief that there is no hope for one’s life improving. These beliefs can make it difficult to seek healthcare. It can interfere with receiving and responding to the healthcare that is provided. It can lead to survivors not following through with treatment recommendations.</p></p></div></li>

 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Devaluation of self</strong><br><br>Survivors who were chronically traumatized often come to believe that they are bad, worthless, damaged goods and so on. This negative view of self leads to a belief that they are not worthy or deserving of healthcare or that the healthcare provider will view them as such. This interferes with both seeking care or stating their needs when receiving care. It may lead to them not following through on treatment recommendations because they do not believe that they deserve it.</p></p></div></li>

 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Believe deserving of bad things</strong><br><br>The belief that one deserves bad things can make it difficult to recognize when one is in need of healthcare. It can also reinforce a lack of self care as well as engaging in self harm behaviours.</p></p></div></li>

 <div style="display:none;" class="reveal">
<p> 
<p class="simplebox"><strong>Believe people are not trustworthy</strong><br><br>Trauma survivors who have been violated by trusted others will feel that they have been betrayed by those who should have had their best interests in mind. Given that one cannot trust those who should presumably care about you, then who can be trusted? Authority figures, in particular, often become the least trustworthy. This makes it difficult to trust one’s health provider and can lead to avoidance of healthcare or an unwillingness to be completely forthcoming about one’s health-related needs. There may be an underlying fear that any vulnerability they display will be used against them.</p></p></div></li>

Survivors of child abuse may have been provided drugs or alcohol as a way to control them and overtime they learned to use these strategies to numb their feelings. Sex might be a strategy that is used to enhance a sense of power and control at a time that they are otherwise feeling powerless or out of control. Foods such as candy are often used by perpetrators of child abuse as a way to placate the child and over time food becomes a way to numb feelings, especially if eaten in large quantities.</p></p></div></li>
