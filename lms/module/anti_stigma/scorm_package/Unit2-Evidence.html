<h1>Evidence-based Psychotherapy for PTSD</h1>

<p>Research on psychotherapy for PTSD  supports the use of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapies. The therapies with the strongest evidence for decreasing symptoms of PTSD are those therapies which contain an <a href="href" class='alink' rel='#mies1'><em>exposure</em> component</a>.<sup class="ref">40</sup>,<sup class="ref">30</sup>,<sup class="ref">18</sup></p>
<p>
  The psychotherapies with the most evidence of efficacy in the treatment of PTSD are: </p>

</ul>
<p>Most of these psychotherapies recommend between 10 and 20 individual, 60 to 90 minute sessions, to achieve remission or a significant reduction in symptoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There is some evidence in the literature that all else being equal, first-line treatment of simple PTSD should be with one of the evidence-based psychotherapies.  However, if the patient has not shown improvement after 8 to 10 sessions, the physician and psychotherapist should consider a trial of another evidence-based psychotherapy and/ or the introduction of pharmacotherapy. As well, the choice of treatment must also take into account the patient’s preference and the availability of psychotherapy in the local community. To date, there is no strong evidence that a combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is superior to either treatment alone. However, as neuroimaging and other biological research expands our understanding of the psychobiological dysfunctions present in PTSD,<sup class="ref">9</sup>,<sup class="ref">19</sup>,<sup class="ref">20</sup>,<sup class="ref">84</sup> some argue that it may be less useful to create “false dichotomies” between “brain” and “mind” (Stein, et al, 2009, p 15) and reasonable to conclude that both psychological and biological interventions can be efficacious in the treatment of PTSD and that often a combination of the two may be indicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients with PTSD can also benefit from a range of treatment modalities to complement their  individual psychotherapy including, <a href="href" class='alink' rel='#mies2'>group psychotherapy</a>, couple therapy,<sup class="ref">68</sup>,<sup class="ref">69</sup> and/or family therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is limited empirical evidence on treatment for patients who have experienced complex trauma. However, there is a rich clinical literature on the <a href="href" class='alink' rel='#mies3'>treatment of Complex PTSD</a>.</p>

<h3>Access to Psychotherapy for PTSD</h3>
<p>Access to psychotherapists who are knowledgeable and experienced in treating trauma survivors can be a challenge in small and remote communities. If you are in a community where there are no therapists, it is important to know that as their primary care physician, you can make an important difference and support their healing. Applying the principles of trauma-informed care as outlined in this course and, if possible, taking time to talk to your patient about whatever is on their mind can make a difference.</p>
<p>An  important first step in finding a psychotherapist for your patients with PTSD,  is to get to know the therapists in your community.</p>
<p>Below we offer some questions that you can ask a psychotherapist or counsellor to help you decide whether that individual would be an appropriate person to whom you can refer your traumatized patients:</p>
<ol>
 <li>What experience do you have treating trauma survivors?</li>
 <li>Are you familiar with the three phases of trauma treatment and how do you incorporate it into the treatment plan?</li>
 <li>What is your approach to the treatment of trauma?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="simple_overlay" id="mies1">
<h3>Exposure phase</h3>
The exposure phase of therapy is when the patient spends time remembering  and confronting the trauma-related memories. This is helpful because patients with PTSD develop both cognitive and behavioral strategies to avoid anything that reminds them of the traumatic event. Since the triggers or reminders of traumatic events can be multiple and diffuse, patients become increasingly avoidant in an attempt to limit their own distressing emotional reactions to these reminders or triggers. Over time, patients avoid more and more and their belief that the world is a dangerous place becomes reinforced. Their avoidance prevents new learning which could help decrease the power of these reminder events; instead the need for further avoidance is reinforced. The original fear responses related to the trauma become generalized to all kinds of events and triggers. Exposure therapy involves patients deliberately remembering the details of the trauma in a controlled and safe therapeutic environment. This gives them a corrective experience where they learn that the memories and triggers, though distressing, do not need to overwhelm them and will not destroy them.  The patient can then discuss these experiences with the therapist and the therapist can help reinforce a sense of control and mastery for the patient. The therapist also helps patients reality-test, or challenge their distorted, trauma-based beliefs, such as “the world is a dangerous place” or “no one can be trusted” or “I am weak and cannot protect myself”. 
</div>

<div class="simple_overlay" id="mies2">
<h3>Group psychotherapy</h3>
Group psychotherapy for trauma survivors can be highly beneficial for patients dealing with either simple or complex PTSD. Being in a group with others who share similar experiences can reduce the sense of isolation, normalize the survivor&rsquo;s experience, provide hope that healing is possible, and allow the survivor to feel understood and accepted. Group members are often more effective in challenging a survivor&rsquo;s view of themselves than is a therapist. It is usually best that the group is facilitated by a mental health professional who is knowledgeable about psychological trauma. While peer support groups can be helpful, a peer-led trauma group runs the risk of group members triggering each other and lacking the tools to prevent or recover from retraumatization of the members.
</div>

<div class="simple_overlay" id="mies3">
<h3>Psychotherapy for Complex PTSD</h3>
<p>There is limited empirical evidence on treatment for patients who have experienced complex trauma. However, there is a rich clinical literature on the treatment of Complex PTSD. Thus, we draw on both the existing research literature on treating complex trauma as well as the clinical literature for our psychotherapy treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>For patients with childhood-onset PTSD where the trauma was abusive, chronic or unremitting, and especially if it occurred at the hands of a trusted adult, 10 to 20 sessions of psychotherapy is usually not  sufficient to treat their complex PTSD. Patients with a history of complex trauma generally benefit from psychotherapy that is of a longer duration ranging anywhere from months to years. As previously mentioned, some patients with Complex PTSD will remain in phase 1 of treatment indefinitely. Such patients may also benefit from the other treatment modalities mentioned above, including <a href="href" class='alink' rel='#mies2'>group psychotherapy</a>, couple therapy, and/or family therapy.   <br>
 <br>
 There is some evidence of cognitive processing therapy being effective for complex trauma.<sup class="ref">82</sup> Other short-term treatments that have preliminary evidence for treating Complex PTSD include emotion-focused trauma therapy<sup class="ref">75</sup>, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing<sup class="ref">90</sup>, imagery rehearsal / rescripting therapy<sup class="ref">58</sup>,<sup class="ref">95</sup>, skill training for affect and interpersonal regulation<sup class="ref">24</sup>, and seeking safety.<sup class="ref">71</sup> However, it should be remembered that these short-term interventions are not likely to be sufficient for healing from complex trauma but are useful for doing a portion of the work required for healing from complex trauma.</p>
Patients with histories of chronic traumatisation can benefit from longer term therapy with therapists who are knowledgeable about trauma and who are relational in their approach.<sup class="ref">26</sup> The opportunity to experience a longstanding therapeutic relationship that is trustworthy, consistent, safe and caring can slowly heal the deep developmental wounds that have shaped the individual&rsquo;s experience of self and the world.
