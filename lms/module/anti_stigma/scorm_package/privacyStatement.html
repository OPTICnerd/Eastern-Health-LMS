<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>The CMA protects the privacy of personal and other information regarding participants and educational collaborators. The CMA will not release personally identifiable information to a third party without the individual's consent, except such information as is required for reporting purposes to the body or bodies accrediting this educational module for MainPro or Maintenance of Certification study credits.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  As part of this reporting requirement, evaluation data (registration/completion statistics, pre/post-test and satisfaction survey) is collected and reviewed to determine if a module meets participants&rsquo; learning needs. The data is also used to improve existing modules and to inform the development of future offerings.  All evaluation data is reported in aggregate, with no identifying information included. Given the importance and potential impact of some modules, aggregate evaluation data may also be presented and/or published at times.</p>
