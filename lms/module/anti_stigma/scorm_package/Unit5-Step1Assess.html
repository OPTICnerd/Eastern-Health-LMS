<h2>Diagnostic Screening Interview</h2>
<p>
 This interview can be used for any patient especially your particularly challenging patients, the ones you are least comfortable and confident with, and where stigma can be an issue. Watch the video and see how the physician interviews the patient observing what things she does to show her empathy, respect, lack of judgment, efficiency. Watch how she gives hope about recovery, and engages the patient, all in a very time efficient manner. It can be done. Note the lack of blaming, the compassion, the  lack of professional distancing. The  physician is moving towards the patient not away. </p>

 <strong>Let&rsquo;s watch the doctor administer the diagnostic screening interview. </strong></p>

 Although the family doctor knows this patient well, she has never broached the topic of substance abuse with Jan and was unaware that it was complicating recovery. By asking the right questions, and providing a respectful forum in which the patient can be heard and given hope, the Diagnostic Screening Interview enables the doctor to begin to overcome stigmatizing attitudes.</p>
