<h1>Chapter Summary</h1>
<p>There are many causes of poor health, including biology, personal behaviours and access to health services. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Health is also profoundly influenced by social factors, such as income and social status. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The CODE RED research carried out in Hamilton illustrates well the effects of social determinants on health. For example, the  same population in the lowest 20% for family income has the highest hospital admission rate. Â  <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The literature offers three reasons that explain the impact of income on health: material deprivation, psychological impact and  personal behaviours. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Differences in epigenetics may further mediate some of the differences in health outcomes between income groups. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Air pollution, smoking and education have also been linked with low income and poor health.</li>
</ul>
