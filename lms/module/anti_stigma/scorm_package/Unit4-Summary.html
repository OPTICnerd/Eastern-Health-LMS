<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li> Depression: a complex disorder</li>
 <ul>
<li> Depression is multidimensional</li>
<li> The lack of full recovery from a depressive episode can negatively influence the course of illness</li>
</ul> 
 <li>Neurobiological underpinnings</li>
 <ul>
<li> MDD, pain, and stress are all associated with similar suppression of neurotrophic factors and compromised neuroplasticity </li>
<li> brain derived neurotrophic factor  (BDNF)  may be altered in depression and pain, leading to structural and functional changes</li>
</ul> 
 <li>Multidimensional treatment </li>
 <ul>
<li> Treatment may ameliorate functional, and thus structural, changes in the brain</li>
<li> Activation of 5HT (serotonin),and/or NE (norepinephrine), and/or DA (dopamine) may restore neuroprotective benefits, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis</li>
<li> Guideline recommended treatment of MDE includes Psychotherapies (CBT-Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and IPT-Interpersonal Therapy) as well as Somatic Therapies (antidepressant medications, light therapy, ECT) </li>
<li> Empower patients to take an active in their illness and achieving optimal wellness.  </li>
