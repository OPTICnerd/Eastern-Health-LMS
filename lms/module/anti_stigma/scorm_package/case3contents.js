There were no complications following the surgery however her pain  scores, which were 2/10 post operatively, have been increasing over the last 2  years.</p><p>  Cecily tells you that her pain scores are currently at 8/10  and are consistently interfering with her ability to do housework, work full  time at a desk job, and care for her family. She has been getting increasingly  frustrated and anxious with regards to her pain and decreased function. She has  been managed previously by a pain specialist however he retired shortly after  Cecily&rsquo;s surgery. She has been desperate over the last few months and was  re-assessed by her surgeon who prescribed oxycodone 5mg/acetaminophen 325mg one  tablet qid prn, a two month supply with no repeats. Her surgeon advised her  there was nothing more he could offer and recommended follow up with her  general practitioner for ongoing medical management.</p><p>  Cecily comes to your office today for medication evaluation.  She states that her pain has worsened in the last month and the oxycodone  5mg/acetaminophen 325mg one tablet qid prn was not as beneficial as she had  hoped.&nbsp; She is wondering if there is  something stronger that she can take.</p>";
