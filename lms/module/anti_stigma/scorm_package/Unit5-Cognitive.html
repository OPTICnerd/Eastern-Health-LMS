<h1>Cognitive Behavioural Interpersonal Skills (CBIS) program</h1>



<p>We are going to introduce  you to one structured time-efficient program which will demonstrate ways in  which you can implement your newly changed attitudes by enhancing healthy  social contact and communication, and decreasing social distance with your  patients. This program has been  evaluated in BC to increase Family Physician comfort and confidence in treating  patients with mental health issues, maintaining its results for 6 months at  least.  As well,  this program has been evaluated to improve the patient experience so that they  feel more heard and understood, more comfortable and more of a partner with  their family physician or healthcare professional. They also felt they had more questions  answered and had more materials and activities to use in their treatment. This  program is called the Cognitive Behavioural Interpersonal Skills (CBIS)  program, was developed in BC, and forms the core of the BC Practice Support  Program which has now trained  &gt;1400/3300 of BC&rsquo;s family physicians.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We  will go through the step by step components of CBIS from diagnostic screening  through to the development of an action plan to specific CBT training skills  for your patients highlighting how the tools enhance healthy social  contact  and communication and decrease  social distance. </p>
