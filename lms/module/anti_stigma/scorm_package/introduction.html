<h1>Overview </h1>
<p>Welcome to this Web-Based Continuing Medical Education (CME) course program entitled &ldquo;<strong>Combating Stigma for Physicians and Other Health Professionals</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 This interactive online course intends to educate family physicians and specialists in the recognition of stigma related to mental illness.  The course is designed to provide participants with an opportunity to recognize attitudes and behaviours that could potentially lead to stigma as well as provide an example of a practical clinical approach to helping doctors, other healthcare professionals and patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 <strong>&ldquo;Combating Stigma for Physicians and Other Health Professionals&rdquo;</strong> is also introducing a fairly novel idea that we are not only after attitudinal change but also process or implementation change.&nbsp; This approach will address some of the challenges of stigma especially social distancing, healthy social contact and good communication.</p>
