Before starting opioids, a discussion with the patient about specific goals related to pain reduction and functional improvement should address any unrealistic expectations. These agreed-on goals should be documented in the patient's record; they are critical in determining that opioids are effective and should be monitored over time.</p><p>Sharon: Sharon would like to be able to do some grocery shopping without feeling like her pain is 8-10/10 and needing to rely on 'looking like an old lady' in public. Discussing with Sharon realistic goals (decreasing pain scores by 30% - 10->7/10) and slowly building to larger goals over time are appropriate. Starting with smaller goals (if you can walk 10 steps without stopping now, goal would be 13 steps) and moving towards increasing improvements over time.
