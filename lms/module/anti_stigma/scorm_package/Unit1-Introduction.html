    <p>While significant progress has been made in decreasing stigma and discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation and religion, stigma against people with mental illness and psychiatric issues remain prevalent in society (Link &amp; Phelan, 2001).  </p>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p> The adverse effects of stigma and discrimination include delay in seeking medical treatment, early treatment discontinuation, difficulties in obtaining housing and other adverse economic effects.  Within healthcare, stigma has been described as the &ldquo;primary barrier&rdquo; to treatment and recovery and, in combination with discrimination, represents one factor in diminished life expectancy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This module is designed to help physicians and other health professionals recognize and manage stigma in practice.  Using a case based approach the module leads the learner through a series of primary care cases exploring issues related to stigma and provides a practical approach to reducing the risk of stigmatizing behaviour in practice. </p>
