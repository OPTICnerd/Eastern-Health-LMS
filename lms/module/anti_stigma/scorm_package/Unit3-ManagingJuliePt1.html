<p>The doctor notices scars on Julie&rsquo;s arms. There are many. Some scars have clearly been there for quite some time, while others look more recent. One wound is likely only a few days old. When the doctor asks about the scars and the wound, Julie says it is from playing with her cat. The doctor is aware that Julie has a trauma history. </p>

<p><strong>What should the doctor do?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="incorrect">Chosen Answer: 1. Show respect to the patient by accepting the patient’s answer and warn the patient about the risks associated with cat scratches.</strong></p>
<p>This approach has the advantage of being respectful of the patient but it may convey to the patient that the doctor is naïve about the impact of chronic childhood trauma. This will undermine a sense of safety and make it less likely for the patient to be open and honest about her struggles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong class="correct">Correct Answer: 2.	Gently challenge the patient and provide psychoeducation on self-harm as a coping strategy for trauma survivors.</strong></p>
<p>It is important that the physician address this possibility in a compassionate and clear manner. Providing psychoeducation will convey that the physician understands the impact of trauma, help to establish a safe environment and normalize the patient&rsquo;s behaviour which may make it easier for the patient to talk about it. It is also an opportunity to suggest that there may be better ways of coping.<br><br>
 Although Julie has been engaging in self harm for quite some time, it is important for the doctor to address it without delay. This communicates a number of important messages to Julie. One is that it suggests that her doctor recognizes the impact of trauma and takes it seriously. Two, it conveys a concern for Julie&rsquo;s wellbeing, which she has likely not experienced in much of in her life. Three, it suggests that her doctor is not afraid to broach difficult issues. Four, it will instil confidence in her doctor and contribute to a sense of safety.</p>

<p><strong class="incorrect">Chosen Answer: 
  <label>3.	Challenge the patient and express your concern that these are suicide attempts.</label>
</strong></p>
<p>This is a potential approach but may not be the best. Multiple scars are more likely to indicate self harm and leaping to the conclusion that it is indicative of suicide attempts may suggest a lack of understanding and put the patient on the defensive. While it is important to rule out suicidality, this can be done once the topic of self injury has been opened up. Helping the patient to understand the function of the self-harm is a necessary step in finding better coping strategies. Asking about suicidality can be a part of the larger conversation about the function of the self-harm.</p>

<p><strong class="incorrect">Chosen Answer: 
  <label>4.	Continue to monitor on an out-patient basis, ask Julie to schedule a follow-up apt.</label>
</strong></p>
<p>This option suggests that the doctor is keeping her concerns to herself, which is not very helpful to Julie. It is not clear what the doctor has in mind regarding how to handle this situation.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>This is an appropriate response but the reason for making the referral should be communicated to Julie. One aim of counselling should be to help Julie find better ways of coping.</p>
