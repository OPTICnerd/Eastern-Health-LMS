<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Health Care providers are in a unique and privileged position to reduce stigma. One of the best ways is to provide and model&nbsp; high quality equitable health care for persons with mental health condition for both their physical and mental health problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best evidenced interventions include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>contact based education;</li>
 <li>ensuring equity for mental health by structural policy; and</li>
 <li>legislative change in keeping with the physician&rsquo;s role as advocate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Promising newer research demonstrates that enhancing health care provider medical expert clinical skills can increase their sense of mastery and clinical effectiveness when treating patients and thereby reduce avoidance (Weinerman, R et&nbsp; al). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Increasing organic biologic knowledge of mental health conditions, in addition to the psychosocial aspects, may help&nbsp; physicians legitimize mental illness and broaden the limited mind vs. body split, physical vs. mental, functional vs. organic paradigm that unknowingly structures physician thinking and behavior. (Ungar T, Knaak&nbsp; S, 2013).</p>
