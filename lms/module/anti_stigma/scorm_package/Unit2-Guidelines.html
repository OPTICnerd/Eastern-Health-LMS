    Phase 1: Safety and Stabilization
  </p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans1a">
Phase 1 of treatment is the <strong>&ldquo;safety and stabilization phase&rdquo;</strong> where the patient and therapist  work collaboratively to help the patient establish internal and external safety  in their lives and stabilization of their symptoms, including hyperarousal,  hypoarousal, poor sleep, interpersonal difficulties,  affect instability, and in some cases, their  chronic self-harm behaviors or suicidality. Phase 1 treatment addresses  internal and external threat. The focus is on safety planning and developing  internal and external resources to help the patient attain and maintain safety  and stability in their lives. Success in establishing safety and stability will  partly depend on the extent to which this effort is supported or impeded by the  patient&rsquo;s environment. Improving sleep, which helps increase internal stability  and decrease other symptoms, may be one goal of phase 1 treatment.  Psychoeducation about trauma and its effects  is also an important component of phase 1 treatment. For some patients with Complex PTSD (or dissociative identity disorder), it may be necessary to remain in phase 1 of treatment indefinitely.

   Phase 2: Working with Memories</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans2a">
Phase 2 of treatment, sometimes called <strong>&ldquo;remembering and mourning</strong>&rdquo;, or the<strong> &ldquo;exposure phase&rdquo;</strong> involves discussing  and processing traumatic memories. It is appropriate to start phase 2 when the  patient is sufficiently safe and stable. Processing traumatic memories can be  destabilizing and thus the processing of traumatic memories should be done with  a therapist experienced in treating trauma survivors. If the patient becomes  too destabilized, it may be necessary to return to phase 1 treatment to  restabilize before continuing. In phase 2 of treatment, patients will, in the  context of the relationship with their therapist, remember, talk about, and  work through their traumatic memories, and challenge their trauma-based beliefs  about themselves, other people, and the world. Exposure therapy often  involves graduated exposure to the traumatic  memories (i.e., starting with the least distressing memory rather than the most  distressing memory of trauma).<sup class="ref">26</sup>

   Phase 3: Reintegration</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
Phase 3 of treatment, often called the &ldquo;<strong>reintegration phase</strong>&rdquo;, involves patients  taking the new skills and beliefs about themselves and the world, and trying  them out. This tends to be a much more practical stage, where patients practice  what they have learned, and in this way, further challenge their  trauma-engendered beliefs and attitudes, and replace these beliefs with a more  realistic, and hopeful understanding of themselves and their environment. Patients work towards consolidating their treatment gains and applying what they have learned to their work lives, relationships and community.
