<h1>Case Conclusion</h1>

<p><img src="Julie.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="238" align="left" style="margin-right:15px; margin-bottom:10px;"/>Julie found a therapist who was experienced in working with adult survivors of child abuse. She and her therapist agreed that the first goal of therapy was to help her to establish safety and stability in her life. They are addressing the lack of safety she feels internally and as well as the behaviours she engages in that create lack of safety externally. She is slowly learning and experimenting with more adaptive coping strategies to deal with her emotions. She is beginning to identify the triggers that lead to her feeling overwhelmed. When overwhelmed with negative emotions, she is trying other strategies for coping such as holding an ice cube in her hand, rather than cutting. She is recognizing that going to bars alone is a trigger. So now, she either doesn’t go or she makes sure she has a friend with her. Changing how she feels about herself is a slow process and she is coming to accept that healing is not linear, so that when she does make “mistakes” she is able to forgive herself and to learn from them. It is interesting to her that since she started therapy her “stomach problems” have not been bothering her as much. She can actually allow herself to feel somewhat hopeful about her future. To rule out any possible physical causes for her gastro-intestinal symptoms, her family doctor had also ordered a diagnostic workup for physical causes of her symptoms and the results were negative. With a family doctor who understands the impact of trauma and a therapist with expertise in trauma, she is learning new coping skills and feels supported and cared for in a way that is new to her. </p>
