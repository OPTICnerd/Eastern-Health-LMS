<p>Two weeks later, Robert returned to see you, accompanied by his wife. They asked questions about the medications and psychotherapies theyâ€™d read about, and his wife asked about getting more information and some support for herself. They also asked about the possibility of arranging some couple therapy in the future.</p>

	<p>Robert said his symptoms had not changed, and his sleep was also about the same.  But he said he felt more optimistic after your last appointment and reading the information, and talking things over with his wife. Also, Robert said he had stopped drinking, and his wife verified this.</p>

	<p>Robert said  he was willing to try one of the antidepressant medications for PTSD.  He also asks you if there is a sleeping medication he could try once in a while, if he felt he really needed to sleep. </p>
<p>You give him a prescription for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sertraline 50 mg qam x 2 weeks&rsquo; supply</li>
  <li>Trazadone 50 mg qhs prn x 2 weeks&rsquo; supply</li>
</ul>
You also do some patient teaching on expected therapeutic effects and possible side effects of the medications, and warn Robert not to drink alcohol while taking these medications. Robert agrees to this.

  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
 	<p>You ask Robert if he had been to  Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) to make a claim for PTSD.  He said he has not done this yet, but has looked at  <a href="http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/services/health/mental-health" target="_blank"><span class='has-tip tip-top' data-width='350' title='This is an external link for additional reference purposes only.

You strongly recommend that he make an appointment with the VAC office nearest his home, to see a VAC case manager, who would help Robert make a  claim for entitlements related to having military-related PTSD. You inform Robert and his wife that if his claim is accepted, Robert would be entitled to have the cost of therapy and medications, as well as other services, paid for by VAC. You also suggest he ask the VAC case manager for the contact information for the local Operational Stress Injury Clinic, where Robert would be able to get a clinical assessment and other clinical services, most likely including couple counselling, on the referral of his VAC case manager. Robert agrees to do this.</p>
