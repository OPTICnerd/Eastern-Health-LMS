<h1>Overview</h1>



<p>Now that we have examined the potential for stigma to negatively affect both a patient&rsquo;s health and the delivery of care, we are left with the question of how to enhance skills to support care delivery so that stigma is recognized and reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 As previous materials and videos have shown, mental illness has neurobiological underpinnings. It&rsquo;s treatment - including medications AND talking  therapies like CBT and IPT and psychodynamic therapy â€“ has neurobiological underpinnings (Fuchs, 2004).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Talking with patients, listening to them, hearing them, sharing  problem solving with them, not only goes a long way to relieve symptoms of  mental illness, and may be largely responsible for the placebo effect, but also  significantly fights stigma. This is due to the fact that good communication  diminishes social distance and creates a situation where healthy social contact  is occurring. This is the link between enhancing skills and stigma, similar to using  the process of integration to deal with racial prejudice.  You could do a workshop with social contact  which would reduce prejudice, but by establishing a process such as not  allowing schools to segregate which facilitates contact you may be creating an  ongoing positive process.  Thus we will  present a skill set that may put such a process in action.</p>
