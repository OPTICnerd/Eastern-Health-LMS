   Inquire about trauma</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans1a">
   <p>When there are symptoms reported by the patient that raise the  possibility of underlying trauma, ask the patient to tell you more about the  symptoms they describe. Ask them to describe the symptoms in greater detail.  Inquire about how long they have been aware of these symptoms. Are there  situational factors that might exacerbate them? This might lead to a discussion  of a something that triggers memories (conscious or not) of their previous  trauma. Ask if it is possible that the symptoms might be connected to something  stressful from the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If  there are behaviors that raise the possibility of a history of abuse,  respectfully and objectively name the behavior. For example, &ldquo;I notice that you  have cancelled the last three appointments and that this has happened before.  I&rsquo;m curious about this. Of course, there may be good reasons for each of the  cancellations. Sometimes, however, we find that some patients are uncomfortable  going to the doctor. Do you think that might be an issue for you?&rdquo; If the  patient agrees that they are uncomfortable seeking health care, ask &ldquo;Is there  anything I can do that might make it more comfortable for you?&rdquo; This might then  be followed up with an acknowledgment that sometimes patients have had  experiences either with their health-care provider or with someone else that  has left them feeling unsafe. This can naturally lead to a question about  whether there is a history of trauma. Again all of this is conveyed in the  spirit of wanting to make it more comfortable for the patient to receive care.</p>

   Convey compassion and non-judgment</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans2a">
   <p>It is important to convey acceptance of what the patient is saying and an ability to understand from the patient’s perspective and without judgment. This is an empathic stance where the physician communicates an understanding of the patient’s experience from the patient’s perspective and does so without any implicit judgment of the person. Allowing the patient to feel understood and accepted will create a safe space for the patient to disclose more and to engage in conversation about health matters.</p>
