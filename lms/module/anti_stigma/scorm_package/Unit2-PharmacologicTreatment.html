<h1>Pharmacologic Treatment of PTSD</h1>


<p>There is good evidence for the pharmacologic treatment of PTSD.<sup class="ref">41</sup>,<sup class="ref">99</sup>,<sup class="ref">102</sup> There is increasing recognition, through neuro-imaging and other biological research, that PTSD is characterized by specific psychobiological dysfunctions. This research provides one rationale for pharmacologic treatment of the disorder.<sup class="ref">9</sup>,<sup class="ref">19</sup>,<sup class="ref">20</sup>,<sup class="ref">28</sup>,<sup class="ref">84</sup> As well, PTSD is often comorbid with disorders such as major depression, that respond well to pharmacotherapy.<sup class="ref">79</sup> There is evidence from meta-analytic studies that pharmacotherapy is more effective in reducing combat-related PTSD symptoms compared to psychotherapy.<sup class="ref">101</sup>
</p><br>
<p>The goal of pharmacologic treatment of PTSD is to decrease symptoms, including re-experiencing (intrusive thoughts and flashbacks), hypervigilance, hyperarousal (anger, irritability and disturbed sleep), avoidance, and depressive symptoms which are often present with the disorder. Generally, medication has been more effective in treating hyperarousal and mood symptoms, and less effective for re-experiencing, avoidance and numbing  symptoms. However, there is great variability in target symptom response from one patient to the next.</p><br>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab1">
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (eg. Citalopram,  Paroxetine, Sertraline) are first-line medication treatment for PTSD. A Cochrane Review meta-analysis of drug trials for treatment of PTSD found that patients treated with SSRI&rsquo;s showed more improvement in symptoms and functioning than those who received placebo.<sup class="ref">99</sup>  A therapeutic trial should last at least 6 to 8 weeks before deciding the trial has failed.
</div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab2">
Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (eg. Venlafaxine) are also recommended for the treatment of PTSD, though there are fewer studies on their effectiveness, compared to the evidence for SSRI&rsquo;s.<sup class="ref">18</sup> 
</div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab3">
There is growing evidence that atypical antipsychotics, especially Risperidone and Quetiapine, are a safe and effective adjunctive treatment to SSRI’s and SNRI’s for patients who do not respond to antidepressant  treatment alone. Although Olanzapine is also effective, there is more evidence of weight gain and other metabolic side effects with this medication.<sup class="ref">1</sup>,<sup class="ref">99</sup>,<sup class="ref">18</sup> Given the high rates of comorbidity, functional impairment and general refractoriness of PTSD symptoms, patients who do  not respond to an initial trial  of an SSRI or SNRI, should be considered for adjunctive treatment with an atypical antipsychotic (eg. Olanzapine,  Quetiapine, or Risperidone). </div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab4">
Prazosin has been shown to reduce nightmares and improve sleep compared to placebo, in 4 clinical trials studying a total of 124 patients suffering from PTSD. In some of these trials, patients reported an improvement in other PTSD symptoms as well. </div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab5">
Trazadone is a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor /Antagonist which, because of its marked sedative effect, is often used, off-label, as a hypnotic rather than as an antidepressant. Because of its lack of addictive potential compared to many other common hypnotic agents, it may be a preferential medication for sleep problems, and in PTSD, it is often given in combination with a daytime SSRI or SNRI medication.  It is important to consider the risk of Serotonin Syndrome when prescribing a patient more than one serotonergic agent.
</div>

<div class="tab-content" id="tab6">
Although Benzodiazepines are often used for acute anxiety, they should not be used, or used with caution in PTSD. Because of the frequent presence of substance use comorbid with PTSD, there is a significant risk of patients with PTSD becoming addicted to, or abusing, Benzodiazepines. These medications should be used only for acute or emergency situations, their use should be monitored closely, and they should be discontinued as soon as possible.
