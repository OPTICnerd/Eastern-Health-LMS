   <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #D18F23;">Social stigma is a severe social disapproval of or personal discontent with a person on the grounds of their unique characteristics distinguishing them from others in society.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Almost all stigma is based on a person differing from social or cultural norms. Erving Goffman defined stigma as &ldquo;the process by which the reaction of others spoils normal identity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three forms of stigma recognized by Goffman include: </p>
<ul>
<li> The experience of a mental illness (or the imposition of such a diagnosis); </li>
<li> a physical form of deformity or an undesired differentness; or </li>
<li> an association with a particular race, religion, belief, etc. (Goffman, 1990).</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations and criticism of Goffman's theory are that it is labelling and blames the individual or victim of the stigma.</p>
