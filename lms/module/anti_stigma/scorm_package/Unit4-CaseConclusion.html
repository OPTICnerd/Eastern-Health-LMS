        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Robert has continued on the medication with good effect.  Over the past 6 months his symptoms gradually subsided, and his sleep improved  to the point where he was able to discontinue the sleeping medication with no  ill effect.  He has remained off alcohol.  The two of you have discussed the antidepressant and, given the length of  time he had been symptomatic,  the degree  of disability his symptoms had caused,and his positive response with no  significant side effects,  you  recommended that Robert stay on his SSRI for another 6 months, at which time  you both would again re-evaluate the  medication. Robert agreed, saying &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I want to rock the boat too  much at this point, Doc.  I haven&rsquo;t felt  this good in years.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>With his wife&rsquo;s support, Robert contacted his local VAC office,  and he was assigned a case manager. With her referral, he had a diagnostic  assessment at the local Operational Stress Injury (OSI) clinic in their city.  He and his wife were able to have couple therapy through this clinic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> At this point, six months after first telling you  about his trauma history, Robert is interested in considering individual  psychotherapy to help with his remaining symptoms, and his VAC case manager  has given him a list of potential therapists in his community who have worked  with veterans with PTSD.</p>

        <p>Next week, Robert has two job interviews. </p></td>
