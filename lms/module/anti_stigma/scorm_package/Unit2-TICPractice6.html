<h1>TIC Practice #6: Recognize Signs and Symptoms of Current Self-harm</h1>



<p>Self-injury can be one of the most troubling symptoms for health  providers to recognize, understand and respond to. Research on the attitudes of healthcare providers towards those who self-injure suggests that irritation and  anger are common reactions of healthcare providers in general medical settings.<sup class="ref">86</sup> A lack of confidence in knowing how to deal with patients  who self-injure is a common problem.<sup class="ref">42</sup> However, training on the topic can lead to improved attitudes and confidence.<sup class="ref">86</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deliberate self-injury can take a variety of forms, such as, cutting, hair pulling, scratching/picking, self poisoning, hanging, asphyxiation with CO/other gas, bruising, burning, etc. The most common forms of self-injury are  cutting, scratching, bruising and burning. Typically, patients do not go to  their doctor to discuss their self harm. However, the self harm may be so  physically damaging that they require health care, such as needing stitches for  a deep cut or antibiotics for an infected wound. At other times, the patient  may be seeking care for an unrelated health concern but they present in such a  way that deliberate self harm is suspected. For example, there may be bruises  on the body, evidence of a recent wound, unusual scarring, etc. </p>

   <p>When deliberate self-injury is detected, the first step is to determine whether the behavior was an instance of non-suicidal self-injury or whether it was a genuine suicide attempt. The physician might simply and compassionately ask, “Was this a suicide attempt?” Discuss the intent of the act with the patient.</p>

  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans2a">
   <p>Regardless of intent, it is also important to assess the degree of self harm or the danger associated with the particular form of self-harm. If there is grave danger associated with the self-harm, the physician should convey concern and provide information about the risk and avoid expressions of judgment or alarm.</p><br>
<p>Although non-suicidal self-injury is not a suicide attempt, there is an increased risk for suicide among those who engage in non-suicidal self-injury. Research has found the 50-70% of adolescents who self-injured reported at least one previous suicide attempt.<sup class="ref">70</sup>,<sup class="ref">72</sup> The method of self-injury may assist in identifying those at greater risk of suicide.<sup class="ref">8</sup> The more dangerous the method of self-injury, the more thorough the assessment should be.</p>

  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
  <p>With a respectful curiosity, the physician can ask, “What does the self-injury do for you?” The most common answer will be that it helps to manage the intense emotional distress. Knowing the function of the self-harm, the physician is in a position to help the survivor consider other ways to satisfy that need.</p><br>
<p>There are a range of reasons for why people self-injure.<sup class="ref">57</sup> Affect regulation is the most common. Self-injury can be a way to manage intense and overwhelming negative feelings. Relief or calm often follows self-injury.<sup class="ref">56</sup> Self-injury can be a way of punishing the self. Less common is that it is an attempt to influence someone else (e.g., to garner affection). It can be used as a way to manage dissociative symptoms such as feeling numb or unreal. Paradoxically, it can be used as a way to resist urges to attempt suicide. Some might use it to experience excitement.</p>

  <p>Gather information about the history of self-injury as well as the current

It is also important to understand the context in which the self-harm occurs and the triggers to self-harm. By understanding the triggers to self-harm, this can provide some clues as to strategies for avoiding self-harm.</p>

  <p>There is often a lot of shame is response to having self-harmed.

   Discuss other options for coping</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans7a">
  <p>In a nonjudgmental way, open up a conversation to discuss other options that the patient could consider for dealing with these difficult feelings. It is important to recognize that other, more benign strategies for coping will not give as immediate and complete a relief as the self-harm. The goal is to reduce self-injury and eventually replace it with more adaptive coping strategies. The patient should be encouraged to come up with a list of alternative coping strategies that she can try first before she resorts to the self-harm. Even delaying self-injury while trying out alternative coping strategies can be helpful by allowing some time to pass and the intensity of the negative emotion to lessen; then, if the patient can no longer resist the self-harm, it is likely to be less extreme.</p><br>
<p>Helping the patient to come up with their own list is likely to be more effective. At the same time, providing the patient with some ideas can stimulate the patient’s creative thinking. As always, a collaborative approach to generating the list is ideal. Alternative behaviours can include activities to symbolize the act, distraction, physical activities, delaying the behaviour, social support, imagery, art and writing. Some specific ideas for dealing with the urge to self-harm include: wait 15 minutes, do mindful diaphragmatic breathing, call a friend, do strenuous exercise to raise your heart rate, put your hand in a bucket of ice, snap an elastic band on your wrist, punch a pillow, take a hot bath or shower.</p><br>
<p>Inform the patient that alternatives to self-injury are usually not as effective in the short-term. However, the goal is that with practice and over time, these strategies will serve the function that the self-injury behaviour accomplished. </p>
