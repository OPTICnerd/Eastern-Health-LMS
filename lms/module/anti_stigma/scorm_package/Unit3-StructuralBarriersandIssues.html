<h1>Structural Barriers and Issues</h1>

<div class="Wrapper">
  <div class="Column03Left">
<p>Structural stigma and discrimination refers to institutional accumulated practices that work to the disadvantage of mental health patients even in the absence of individual prejudice or discrimination. This &ldquo;disabling environment&rdquo; is created by the barriers to participation in receiving care that reside in the architecture or structures we have constructed. </p>

 <h2>Reflection Activity</h2>
 <ul>
<li> Pause for a moment to reflect on your experienceâ€¦</li>
<li> Can you think of stigmatizing structural issues, barriers or discrimination (Link, Phelan 2001) to mental health care in your health care practice or organization or system?</li>
<li> Where do patients with mental health problems wait for care? </li>
<li> Where are they seen? </li>
<li> Are they accepted equally to the care group or organization? </li>
<li> Do the health care insurers pay equitably for mental health as for other health problems?</li>
<li> What level of professional status providers see the most acute mental health problems?</li>
</ul>
