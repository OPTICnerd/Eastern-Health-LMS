<h1>Emerging Concepts of Stigma and Disability Policy</h1>
Emerging Concepts of Stigma and Disability-Social Science Research</h2>
<ul>
<li> A Social Problem beyond the individual- Less a personal impairment of the individual (Goffman) which risks biologic reductionism and prospective prognostic negativism, but instead more a characteristic of the social group, their attitudes and social context. Stigma as a social problem and as social discrimination.</li>
<li> Social Justice Model-Movements on autonomy and human rights, civil rights and a right to health (UN convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2007), Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982).</li>
<li> Power Imbalance; &ldquo;Stigma is entirely dependent on social, economic, and political Power&rdquo;, with the stigmatized having less or losing power. &ldquo;In many instance power differences are so taken for granted as to seem unproblematic.&rdquo; (Link and Phelan, p.375, 2001)</li>
<li> Recovery and Hope — As stigma is increasingly perceived as a social problem, individuals have autonomy, responsibility, and participation towards their own recovery.</li>
</ul>

 <ol>
<li> Law and Order Approach — 1800&rsquo;s-Behaviour of people with mental illness and intellectual impairments were dangerous and disruptive and a threat to law and order. They were institutionalized to protect themselves and societies from them. Asylum model 1860-1890.</li>
<li> Medical and Economic Models — 1920-1970&rsquo;s-disability is an attribute of a person who is functionally limited and biologically inferior (Hahn). Unemployment is due to personal deficit and rehabilitation is aimed to return the individual to work as soon as possible.</li>
<li> Sociopolitical Model — 1970&rsquo;s-disability stems not from individual limitations but from the failure of the social environment to adjust to the needs of people with different abilities (Hahn).</li>
