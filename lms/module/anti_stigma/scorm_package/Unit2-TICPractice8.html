<h1>TIC Practice #8: Responding to Disclosures</h1>

<p>The ability to disclose a history of trauma will vary across survivors.  This may depend on their ability to remember what happened. Some may have no  concrete memories but a vague sense that something happened. Others may only  have fragments of memories. Some may be afraid to disclose and others may want  to disclose. Some may disclose at the outset, while others wait or drop hints  as they test the water. Some will be afraid to disclose for fear that they  won&rsquo;t be believed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclosing a history of trauma requires a measure of trust on the part  of the survivor. It is important that the physician honours that trust by  responding appropriately. It is not helpful to express shock, pity, or anger at  the perpetrator. Shock may leave the survivor feeling as though the physician  is ill-equipped to help and, in fact, needs help him or/herself. Pity  objectifies, distances and minimizes the survivor. Anger may frighten the  survivor or put the survivor on the defensive. Anger may make the survivor feel  as though she needs to protect the perpetrator. </p>

  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans1a">
   <p>Do not challenge or ignore what the patient is saying. Instead, validate the patient. Acknowledge and accept what you’ve been told. This can be as simple as saying “I’m sorry that happened to you.” Validation can include acknowledging the prevalence of trauma. It can also include acknowledging the patient’s feeling when it is clear that is difficult for the patient to talk about it.</p>

   <p>Normalize the patient’s reaction to disclosing and to having this history. “Of course this is difficult to talk about. It’s ok to cry. You have good reason to cry about this.” Normalize the challenges that the survivor faces as a result of having a trauma history. “Unfortunately, trauma survivors often struggle with (nightmares, addiction, having the urge to self-injure, etc…)”</p>

   <p>Compassion and nonjudgment is expressed in tone of voice and body language and less in the actual words that are spoken. A statement as simple as “I’m so sorry this happened to you or I understand” can convey compassion and nonjudgment.</p>

   Assure confidentiality</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans4a">
   <p>Trauma survivors can be concerned about confidentiality for a number of reasons and so it is important to always assure confidentiality. Of course, it is important to be clear about the limits of confidentiality. For instance, will it be in their medical chart and who has access? If there is strong concern about confidentiality, discuss the concern and assure that their concerns will be taken into consideration. In Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan a patient can ask that  this part of their medical record be contained in a “<a href="http://ehealthrisk.wikispaces.com/Lock+Box" target="_blank"><span class='has-tip tip-top' data-width='350' title='This is an external link for additional reference purposes only. The site and/or content is not part of this Mainpro/Maincert  accredited program. It will open in a new window.'><strong>lock box</strong></a>”, which means that no one can have access without the patient’s permission. The extent to which you need to have this conversation will depend on the survivor. Survivors may worry about being stigmatized if others know about their trauma history. Some may worry that their loved ones will learn about it. Some trauma survivors who were abused in childhood were threatened with harm to themselves or others if they told anyone about the abuse. Even though, objectively, there is no risk given the age of the survivor, many survivors who were given these messages hold a deep-seated childlike belief that the threat persists. Acknowledging the fear as well as providing a realistic appraisal can be helpful. Even though it might not completely eradicate the fear, it offers and reinforces an alternative perspective. For example, “It seems that the child in you still believes that it is dangerous to tell anyone. Is there an adult part of you that recognizes that this threat is not a real threat anymore?”</p>

   Ask about the immediate impact of having disclosed</p></td>
  <td width="442" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans5a">
   <p>Disclosing is a courageous and risky thing to do. At the end of the discussion, ask how the patient feels now that they have told you. This will be an opportunity to address any lingering concerns that they might have, such as, what do you think of them now that you know about their trauma history? They might have a visceral reaction to the disclosure and need a few minutes to calm themselves. You might help them plan how they can take care of themselves when they leave your office. If the patient does not report having a reaction, they may end up having a delayed reaction. Forewarn the patient about this possibility and come up with a plan for what the patient can do if this were to happen. Have the patient identify coping strategies that they can put into play if they have a delayed reaction. Invite the patient to make an appointment to come back to see you, if desired. For many patients, simply being offered this as a possibility is enough to make them feel supported and secure in the knowledge of having this safety net. </p>
