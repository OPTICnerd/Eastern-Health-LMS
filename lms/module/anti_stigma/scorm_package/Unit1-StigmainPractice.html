<h1>Stigma in Practice</h1>

<div class="Wrapper">
  <div class="Column03Left">
   <p>There is a role for health care practitioners in helping patients address issues of stigma.  By reducing the stigma associated with mental health issues, the practitioner is better able to help patients manage their health.  However, in some cases the practitioner may unknowingly contribute to the stigmatization of their mental health patient.  This may be the result of a practitioner:</p>
<ul>
<li> feeling and showing discomfort;</li>
<li> feeling that they have been inadequately trained and avoiding asking the questions or using any tool other than medications;</li>
<li> feeling too rushed and pressured by time constraints;</li>
<li> not  believing  that  listening and hearing is actual treatment;</li>
<li> not believing that psychiatric disease is as real as physical disease, and actually is physical disease; (reference Ungar T, Knaak S (2013). The Hidden Medical Logic of Mental Health Stigma. Australia and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. Epub ahead of Print 12 Feb 2013)</li>
<li> not believing that the patient, for the best chances of success, can be an equal partner, taking an active part in managing his illness; and</li>
<li> not believing that exercise, relaxation, changing thinking, talking/listening are as real a treatment as drugs and change the brain</li>
</ul>
