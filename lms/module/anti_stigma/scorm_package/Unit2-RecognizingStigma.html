<h1> Overview</h1>
<p>The literature suggests that stigma is associated with certain mental disorders more than others. </p>
 <ul>
<li>Henderson et al (2013) suggest that psychotic disorders are highly stigmatized often perceived as more violent and unpredictable than other mental health problems. </li>
<li>Pescolido et al. (2013) suggest that cross cultural prejudice toward schizophrenia is much higher than depression. </li>
<li>Serafini et al. (2011) suggest a genetic explanation for schizophrenia is more frequently associated with stigmatizing views. </li>
<li>For health providers Szeto, Luong and Dobson (2013) studied undergraduate psychology students and demonstrated that the label &ldquo;depression&rdquo; was perceived more negatively than the general labels of &ldquo;mental disease, mental disorder, mental health problem, or mental illness&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Ungar and Knaak (2013) suggest physicians label and categorize mental illness as a &ldquo;functional&rdquo; Â illness rather than organic which contributes  to stigma.</li>
</ul>

 <h2>Stigma by association</h2>
 <p>&ldquo;Courtesy&rdquo; stigma or stigma by association is a phenomenon which occurs when people who provide care or services to vulnerable populations are also stigmatized by association with the group receiving care.</p>
