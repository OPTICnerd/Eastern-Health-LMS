<p><strong>The expression “symptoms are solutions” is a way to make sense of the various problems (or symptoms) of trauma survivors. How might this conceptualization apply to any of your traumatized patients? In what ways would it be helpful to use this conceptualization? Are there limits to how it is helpful? How does or would this conceptualization change how you practice? </strong></p>
