  Pause for a moment to reflect...</h2>
<p><strong>What do you tell her may be contributing to her symptoms  and working diagnosis of major depressive episode (MDE)? What do you  tell her is the cause if she asks? What is your clinical understanding  of MDE? To what do you attribute each of her symptoms?

  <h3>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): The New Paradigm</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Serious, chronic medical illness, with a downward course if untreated </li>
    <li> Interaction with multiple organ systems</li>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li> Cardiovascular</li>
        <li> Metabolic</li>
        <li> Neurological</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Important to treat both the physical and psychological dimensions of the illness</li>
    <li> Increased urgency to reach goal of complete symptom remission early in the course of the illness</li>
  </ul>
  The  Bio psychosocial model remains relevant to our understanding of  MDD. The recent paradigm includes understanding MDD as a systemic  condition with input from genetic vulnerability, a person&rsquo;s life  experiences and childhood cognitive style, effects of these on their  stress hormones and neuroendocrine axis, and subsequent vulnerability  and likelihood of developing a MDE. Functional and structural brain  imaging and newer technology are helping demonstrate the physiologic  effects during an MDE including inflammation.
