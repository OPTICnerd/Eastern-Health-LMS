<h1>TIC Practice #2: Routine Query About Trauma History when Taking Medical History</h1>

<div align="center">
 <p class="instruction">Click checkbox in the <strong>Principle</strong> column to view/hide the<strong> Details </strong>in the right column.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incorporating routine questions about a trauma history when taking a medical history is recommended. Precede the question with psychoeducation about the prevalence and consequences of trauma. This can be as simple as stating that having a trauma history, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse and neglect in childhood is not uncommon and research shows that a trauma history is associated with a broad range of physical and mental health problems. Providing psychoeducation about prevalence and consequences, along with asking the question, communicates to the patient that you are trauma-informed in your approach to healthcare. Give permission to disclose or not disclose as this gives control to the patient. If the person has a trauma history and they choose not to disclose, providing psychoeducation and asking the question opens the door for the patient to disclose at a later time, if they so desire. When asking about a trauma history, it is not necessary to ask for details.  </p>

<p>Note: There is some <a href="href" class='alink' rel='#mies1'>controversy about universal “screening” for domestic violence</a> (domestic violence screening is not recommended according to WHO)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="simple_overlay" id="mies1">
<p>The issue of universal screening regarding domestic violence, is controversial. The most recent recommendations of World Health Organization (WHO) are against universal screening for domestic violence (WHO, 2013). Although even within the WHO guidelines there is disagreement. The main position recommends against universal screening because there is no research to demonstrate that universal screening results in a decrease in domestic violence and there are no empirically supported interventions for what to do after a woman has screened positive. They advise screening only if a woman appears to be at risk and first line support is available.  A minority position in the WHO recommendations is in favour of universal screening given that it increases detection, there is no evidence that it causes harm, and most physicians are not knowledgeable about signs and symptoms. The studies upon which the WHO recommendations are based were studies that met strict criteria for screening. Experts disagree as to the appropriateness of ignoring a vast body of research that did not meet criteria for screening (see Schachter et al, 2009). We recommend routine inquiry about a trauma history (as opposed to &ldquo;screening&rdquo; in the strict sense). (For a review of the WHO criteria for &quot;screening&quot; see <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/4/07-050112/en/" target="_blank" title="This is an external link for additional reference purposes only.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issues related to domestic violence are sensitive if the woman is currently in a violent relationship. More information and training about domestic violence can be found at <a href="http://www.DVeducation.ca" target="_blank" title="This is an external link for additional reference purposes only.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barriers to screening for domestic violence have been found to include: personal barriers, insufficient resources, perceptions and fears, and patient-related barriers. The most common personal barriers included discomfort, insufficient knowledge and lack of time. Fears included concerns about alienating the patient, concern for their personal, concern about police involvement, and concerns about reactions to the referral. (Sprague, et al., 2012). A study of medical students and surgical residents demonstrated misconceptions about intimate partner violence and inadequate training (Sprague, et al, 2013). Thus, training in domestic violence is important.</p>
