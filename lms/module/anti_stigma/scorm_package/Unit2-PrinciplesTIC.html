  <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans1a">
   <p>Given the high prevalence of trauma and that trauma survivors often do not disclose their trauma history, providers should treat every patient as though they have a trauma history. This means that the provider should incorporate basic principles of trauma-informed care into their routine practice.</p>

   Be sensitive to impact of trauma</p></td>
  <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans2a">
   <p>It is necessary to have an awareness and  understanding of the impact of trauma and to how this can affect the pursuit  and receipt of healthcare. Providers must be aware that a survivor&rsquo;s traumatic  past can be activated by experiences in the here-and-now. Providers should be  aware of the practices and procedures that have a higher likelihood of being  triggers and should engage in ways that will mitigate their effect. The  provider should be knowledgeable about indicators that a patient has been  triggered.</p>

   Explore with your patient/trauma survivor the best way  to view or define their experience (eg. hurt, injured, symptomatic, rather than  sick or defective)</p></td>
  <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
   <p>The provider should view the patient/survivor as having symptoms, or having been injured psychologically as a result of trauma, that something has been done to them as opposed to viewing the survivor as sick or somehow defective. In other words, the survivor should not be blamed or judged. Ask “what happened to you?” rather than “what is wrong with you?”</p><p>Take a strengths-based approach. Acknowledge what the survivor has done in order to survive. View “symptoms” as “solutions.” For example, the survivor may have learned that cutting reduces their intense distress. Cutting became a strategy for coping. Help the survivor to recognize the function of the cutting. Let the survivor know that this “solution” was a brilliant solution under those circumstances as those strategies allowed them to cope. It may still be the only effective solution they know for managing intense distress. Rather than saying “what can we do to help you stop this behaviour?” say “what can we do to help you find a different way to manage your pain?” What other creative and less harmful solution can they experiment with to replace this old coping strategy?</p>

   Ensure safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration,  empowerment</p></td>
  <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans4a">
   <p><p>Harris and Fallot (2001) identified five principles that are essential  for trauma-informed care: safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration and  empowerment. </p>
<ul>
 <li>Ensure  safety. Safety refers to both physical and emotional safety of both the  survivor and staff.</li>
 <li>Trustworthiness.  This refers to the trustworthiness of the provider and staff. This includes  delivering care in a clear and consistent manner and maintaining appropriate  boundaries.</li>
 <li>Choice.  Wherever possible provide the patient with choice and control, even if they are  necessarily small choices.</li>
 <li>Collaboration.  Work in collaboration with the patient. Share power with the patient. Include  them in decision making about how to proceed. Listen to and respect their  perspective.</li>
 <li>Empowerment. Empower the patient by  allowing the patient to have a voice or say in their healthcare. Communicate a  belief in their capacity to reach their goals.</li>
</ul>
