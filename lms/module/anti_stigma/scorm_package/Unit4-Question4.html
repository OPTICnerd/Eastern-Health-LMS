Basic information about clinical major depression and treatment can be explained as part of what is called &ldquo;psychoeducation&rdquo;. Information materials may be helpful for persons to take away or recommendations to credible information sources. Address common myths and explain it&rsquo;s not their fault, it&rsquo;s not a weakness or a sign of intelligence or effort, it&rsquo;s a real medical condition, and it can get better, provide hope. If needed, discuss accommodations or time off work as with any medical illness. Ask about suicide and document a risk assessment. Discuss with them a safety plan to go to an emergency room or crisis services in your region.Â Finally, provide hope for recovery.</p>
