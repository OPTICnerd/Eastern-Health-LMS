<h1>Problems of High-Risk Behavior</h1>


<p>There are a number of important behavioral issues which often present in those with PTSD. These include:</p>

  Suicidal behavior</p></td>
 <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans1a">
 <p>Patients with PTSD may think about suicide frequently, sometimes every day. This is not uncommon for patients with such a history. Research has shown a positive association between PTSD and suicidality, and this association is compounded when major depression is also present.<sup class="ref">76</sup> The fact that the patient has stated that they think about suicide may or may not be indicative of a risk for suicide. To further complicate the picture, although non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is not a suicide attempt, there is an increased risk for suicide among those who engage in NSSI. Research has found the 50-70% of adolescents who self-injured reported at least one previous suicide attempt<sup class="ref">70</sup>,<sup class="ref">72</sup>. The method of self-injury may assist in identifying those at greater risk of suicide.<sup class="ref">8</sup> The more dangerous the method of self-injury, the more intensive the assessment should be. Thus, a risk assessment is needed for medical, ethical and legal reasons. See <em>TIC Practice #7: Recognize Need for Immediate Intervention or Referral Based on Risk</em> for more information on assessing risk. </p>

  Suicidality in the Veteran</p></td>
 <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans2a">
<p>Those who have served in the Canadian Armed Forces may be reluctant to  disclose, or may not realize that they have a mental health problem.<sup class="ref">38</sup>,<sup class="ref">107</sup> As well, military training confers a professional and disciplined demeanor on those who have served. Because of this, veterans and reservists can appear more healthy and &ldquo;together&rdquo; than they actually are. Research has shown that there is an association between the presence of PTSD and suicidality. Comorbid depression further  compounds the risk for suicide in this population.<sup class="ref">76</sup> This means the family physician must be vigilant when assessing the psychological state of these patients. Identifying mental disorders such as PTSD, major depression and substance use disorders is the first step in assessing veterans and reserve force members for suicidality. Those who screen positively for a mental disorder should always be assessed for suicidal ideation including intent, plan, lethality of the plan, and access to lethal means (eg firearms, stockpile of medications). Based on this assessment, appropriate action must be taken by the family physician, and the patient must be monitored  until he/she is no longer at imminent risk.<br><br>Mental disorders, and precipitating crises should be attended to, and  family, friends and other support groups should be enlisted to help the patient. In one U.S. study, only 30% of veterans with a diagnosis of depression who died by suicide had documented evidence of being asked about suicide on their last visit to their physician.<sup class="ref">93</sup>  This highlights the importance and challenges of assessing for suicidality in the veteran population. Members of other &ldquo;paramilitary&rdquo; professions, such as police officers and firefighters, may present with similar clinical profiles and risks for suicide.</p>

  Non-suicidal self-harm behaviour</p></td>
 <td width="336" valign="top"><div style="display:none" id="ans3a">
  <p>There are a range of reasons for why people self-harm.<sup class="ref">57</sup> Affect regulation is the most common. Self-injury can be a way to manage intense and overwhelming negative feelings. Relief or calm often follows self-injury.<sup class="ref">56</sup> Self-injury can also be a way of punishing the self. Less common is that it is an attempt to influence someone else (e.g., to garner affection). It can be used as a way to manage dissociative symptoms such as feeling numb or unreal. Paradoxically, it can be used as a way to resist urges to attempt suicide. Some might use it to experience excitement. Self harm can include such behaviors as trichotillomania (hair pulling), injuring the
skin (e.g., cutting, skin picking, pinching, hitting), injurious masturbation, binge eating, purging, etc.
