<h1>The Effects of Stigma</h1>


<div class="Wrapper">
  <div class="Column01Left">
   <p>This scenario highlights one of the challenges of managing mental health issues in primary care – the issue of stigma. Patients with mental health issues often experience self-stigma in that they may feel ashamed, feel unworthy and undeserving, and don&rsquo;t know what or how to tell you about what is going on with them. As a result, they often keep mental health issues secret. This, in turn, has a negative effect on primary care as there is a relatively high prevalence of mental health issues in the general population. One in 10 people in Canada struggle with mental illness in a given year, and 1 in 5 in a lifetime (Canadian Mental Health Association, 2005; Mood Disorders Society of Canada, 2009). In 2020, it is predicted that depression will be the single leading cause of the global disease burden surpassing both cancer and heart disease (Murray &amp; Lopez, 1996). Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease have a high prevalence of depression which is a risk factor for poor self-care, complications and even death (Katon et al., 2010). Seniors in Canada may face the stigma of getting older, along with the stigma of mental illness (reference Guidelines for Comprehensive Mental Health Services for Older Adults in Canada 2013b as per referenced in needs assessment).</p>
