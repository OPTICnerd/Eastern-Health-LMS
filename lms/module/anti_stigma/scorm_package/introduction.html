<h1>Overview </h1>
<p>Welcome to this continuing medical education (CME) program entitled <em>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Primer for Primary Care Physicians</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of trauma and  stressor-related disorder. PTSD can occur after one has gone through an  extreme emotional trauma that involved the threat of injury or death to  oneself or to others.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> PTSD is characterized by a number of hallmark symptoms, which can  become chronic and severely debilitating to those suffering from this  condition.  It is a disorder which often disrupts all areas of one&rsquo;s  life, including social, occupational, psychological, and physical  functioning.  It is therefore imperative that those suffering from PTSD  receive timely treatment. A family physician is often the first  caregiver whom the person with PTSD will encounter. Because of this,  family physicians are ideally placed to recognize and begin to relieve  the suffering of those with PTSD.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This program will help you recognize PTSD and the strategies available  to help provide care to patients with this condition. The content in  this CPD program is evidence-based and in accordance with the preferred  learning formats identified by physicians. This course integrates  didactic teaching, case-based scenarios, self-assessment, and discussion  with fellow participants.</div>
