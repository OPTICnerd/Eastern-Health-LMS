  <div class="Column03Left">

   <p><strong>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</strong><br>
  <strong>Diagnostic Criteria 309.81 (F43.10)</strong><br>
  <strong>(DSM-5, American  Psychiatric Association, 2013)</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Exposure  to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation in one (or  more) of the following ways:<br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).</li>
      <li>Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.</li>
      <li>Learning that the event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. Note: In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental.</li>
      <li>Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g. first responders collecting human remains, police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Note</strong>:  Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television, movies or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  <li>Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with traumatic events), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:<br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Recurrent,  involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s).<strong> Note:</strong> In children, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of  the traumatic event(s) are expressed.</li>
      <li>Recurrent  distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are related  to the event(s). <strong>Note:</strong> in children, there may be frightening dreams  without recognizable content.</li>
      <li>Dissociative  reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the  traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum,  with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present  surroundings.) <strong>Note: </strong>In children, trauma-specific reenactments may occur  in play.</li>
      <li>Intense  or prolonged psychological distress or marked physiological reactions in  response to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of  the traumatic event(s).</li>
      <li>Marked  physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble  an aspect of the traumatic event(s).<br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  <li>Persistent  avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic events(s), beginning after  the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of the following:<br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Avoidance  of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or  closely associated with the traumatic event(s).</li>
      <li>Avoidance  of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations  activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts or  feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).<br />

    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Inability  to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically due to  dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or  drugs).</li>
      <li>Persistent  and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the  world (e.g., &ldquo;I am bad&rdquo; &ldquo;No one can be trusted,&rdquo; &ldquo;The world is completely  dangerous,&rdquo; &ldquo;My whole nervous system is permanently ruined&rdquo;).</li>
      <li>Persistent,  distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the traumatic event(s)  that lead the individual to blame himself/herself or others.</li>
      <li>Persistent  negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame).</li>
      <li>Markedly  diminished interest or participation in significant activities.</li>
      <li>Feelings  of detachment or estrangement from others.</li>

    </ol>
  <li>Marked  alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s)  beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced  by two (or more) of the following:<br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Irritable  behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically  expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.</li>
      <li>Reckless  or self –destructive behavior.</li>
      <li>Hypervigilance.</li>
      <li>Exaggerated  startle response.</li>
      <li>Problems  with concentration.</li>
      <li>Sleep  disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying sleep, restless sleep).<br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  <li>Duration  of the disturbance (Criterion B, C, D, and E) is more than one month.<br />
    <br />
  <li>The  disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in the social,  occupational or other important areas of functioning.<br />
    <br />
  <li>The  disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effect of a substance  (e.g., medication, alcohol) or another medical condition.<br />
  </ol>
<p><em>Specify</em> whether:<br />
  <br />
  With <strong>dissociative symptoms</strong>: The individual’s symptoms meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, and in addition, in response to the stressor, the individual experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the following: 
<ol>
  <li><strong>Depersonalization</strong>: Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one’s mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly).</li>
  <li><strong>Derealization: </strong>Persistent or recurrent  experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the world around the individual  is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, distant or distorted).</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Note:  to use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological effect of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).</p>
<p><em>Specify</em> if:<br />
  <br />
  <strong>With  delayed expression:</strong> If  the full diagnostic criteria are not met until at lest 6 months after the event  (although the onset and expression of some symptoms may be immediate)</p>
