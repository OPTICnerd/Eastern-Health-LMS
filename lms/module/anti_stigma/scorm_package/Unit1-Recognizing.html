<h2>Risk Factors</h2>
<p>Risk factors for PTSD can be divided into pre-traumatic, peri-traumatic and post-traumatic risk factors. Large meta-analytic studies<span class="ref"></span><span class="ref"><sup>13,74</sup></span> have found the following risk factors to be significant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pre-Traumatic Risk Factors:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Female gender (in civilian not military samples)</li>
  <li>Low socioeconomic status</li>
  <li>Younger age when traumatized</li>
  <li>Less education</li>
  <li>Childhood adversity</li>
  <li>Race (minority status)</li>
  <li>Past psychiatric history</li>
  <li>Family psychiatric history</li>
</ul>
<h3>Peri-Traumatic Risk Factors:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Severity of the trauma</li>
  <li>Peri-traumatic dissociation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Post-Traumatic Risk Factors:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of social support following the trauma</li>
  <li>Subsequent life stressors</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, these large meta-analyses found that risk factors occurring during and after the trauma (severity of the trauma, peri-traumatic dissociation, lack of social support, and subsequent stressors) conveyed the strongest risk for developing PTSD.<span class="ref"></span><span class="ref"><sup>13,74</sup></span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This data suggests that trying to predict who will develop PTSD based on static risk factors such as previous history of mental health problems, a troubled childhood, race or gender, is of questionable value; although these static risk factors conveyed some increased risk, the effect sizes of these factors were small compared to the peri-traumatic and post-traumatic risk factors. Finally, it is important to note that currently what conveys risk for one person to develop PTSD over another person is not well defined.  Therefore, attempting to delineate a set of common pretrauma risk factors or attempting to screen the general population for vulnerablility to develop PTSD is not advisable.<span class="ref"><sup>13</sup></span>
