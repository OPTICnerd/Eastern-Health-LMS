<h1>Explaining the Impact of Income on Health</h1>
<p> The literature offers three common reasons to explain the impact  of income on health:</p>
<ul>
  <li>    <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #8db6ff; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="$('#reveal1').fadeIn()"><strong>Material deprivation</strong></a><br>
      <div id="reveal1" style="display:none;">Low income persons cannot afford the healthy options – adequate fresh fruit and vegetables, for example – and tend to live in neighbourhoods that lack public amenities like parks.</div>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>    <strong><a style="cursor: pointer; color: #8db6ff; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="$('#reveal2').fadeIn()">Psychological impact</a><br></strong> 
      
   <div id="reveal2" style="display:none;">Individuals whose income places them near the bottom of the social hierarchy develop a stressful sense of inferiority and powerlessness with consequent adverse effects on their health. In a clinical setting, it may manifest itself as stress about paying for basic needs like food and shelter, or not being able to relax because of the time needed to care for children, the elderly or holding minimum wage jobs. Low income populations have been shown to have higher levels of stress hormones, like cortisol, which may explain some differences in health outcomes<sup>2</sup>.</div> 
  </li><br>
  <li>    <strong><a style="cursor: pointer; color: #8db6ff; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="$('#reveal3').fadeIn()">Personal behaviours</a> <br></strong>
 <div id="reveal3" style="display:none;">Low income limits available choices; for example, affording gym memberships, team fees and equipment that encourage an active lifestyle.  While often cited as major factors, studies have repeatedly shown that personal behavior differences do not account for the health differences seen between income groups.<br><br>
Also of concern is findings of differences in epigenetics, mediators of gene expression, that have been found between income groups3. These changes in the methylation of genes can be passed on through generations, and may further mediate some of the differences in health outcomes between income groups. </div> </li><br>
